      These go-with-anything spuds will be a crispy sensation once they hit the
      dinner table. What sets them apart from other crispy potatoes you might
      have encountered is the cooking process, which involves parboiling the
      potatoes before crisping them in a skillet.

    <ul>
      <li>Baked Garlic and Herb Potatoes Recipes</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds red new potatoes, unpeeled and cut into 1-in. pieces (about 6
        1/2 cups)
      </li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons + 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Place potatoes, water, and 2 tablespoons of the salt in a large high-sided
      skillet. Bring to a boil over high; boil 5 minutes. Drain; spread potatoes
      in a single layer on baking sheet lined with paper towels. Let stand 10
      minutes. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until
      shimmering. Arrange potatoes in a single layer in skillet; cook, turning
      each potato piece occasionally, until potatoes are browned all over, 12 to
      15 minutes. During final 2 minutes of cook time, stir in garlic powder,
      onion powder, thyme, and chili powder. Remove skillet from heat; stir in
      parsley and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.
