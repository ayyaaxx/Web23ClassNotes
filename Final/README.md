# HW - Due Monday, Week 11

Concept: I plan on creating a website that inspires people of new fashion trends, pieces, and ideas. It's similar to a lookbook where different outfits are put together based off everyday wear, designer shows, and fun looks to replicate. Most of the outfits come from pinterest or seasonal fashion shows. It'll provide looks that are categorized by season giving endless efforts to be of daily use. 

Final Progress: I want to update my midterm project through the implementation of boostrap's css; dropdown buttons, box/border structurings, navbar etc. I also want to possibly implement a carousel or a book like feature through javascript for the lookbook page. I also want to have pop ups and more user input so it's a bit more funner. incorporating an API.
