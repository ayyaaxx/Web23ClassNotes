# HW - Due Monday, Week 11

Concept: I plan on creating a website that inspires people of new fashion trends, pieces, and ideas. It's similar to a lookbook where different outfits are put together based off everyday wear, designer shows, and fun looks to replicate. Most of the outfits come from pinterest or seasonal fashion shows. It'll provide looks that are categorized by season giving endless efforts to be of daily use. 

Final Progress: I want to update my midterm project through the implementation of boostrap's css; dropdown buttons, box/border structurings, navbar etc. I also want to possibly implement a carousel or a book like feature through javascript for the lookbook page. I also want to have pop ups and more user input so it's a bit more funner. incorporating an API.

Explanation of some of your source code (not the entire site but sometime you found challenging or interesting you’d like to share)

- figuring out how to display the info in the modal // pop up when fetching from the API 

What you learned in order to accomplish your project
// I learned a lot about bootstrap layouts like in regards to customizing the css whilst using the row, column components 
// I also learned a lot more with javascript in terms of how you can uses classes like for the book, I used a flipping class that works to perform the rotation effects 
 
Next steps – if you had more time and more tools, what would you do next?
- I want to involve more animations, and make the book bigger and look more appealing to the eye
- I also wanted to implement other APIs, but didn't have the chance to really think that through
