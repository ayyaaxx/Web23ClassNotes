Concept: I plan on creating a website that inspires people of new fashion trends, pieces, and ideas. It's similar to a lookbook where different outfits are put together based off everyday wear, designer shows, and fun looks to replicate. Most of the outfits come from pinterest or seasonal fashion shows. It'll provide looks that are categorized by season giving endless efforts to be of daily use. 

Final Progress: I want to update my midterm project through the implementation of boostrap's css; dropdown buttons, box/border structurings, navbar etc. I also want to possibly implement a carousel or a book like feature through javascript for the lookbook page. I also want to have pop ups and more user input so it's a bit more funner. incorporating an API.

# Final Presentation 

Explanation of some of your source code (not the entire site but sometime you found challenging or interesting you’d like to share)
![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 3.07.33 AM.png>)
- figuring out how to display the info in the modal // pop up when fetching from the API 
- I had to create an object of the component modal to display to information on the card(modal) 


![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-12-22 at 7.29.30 PM.png>)
- understanding how to create a book feature using javascript, css 
- here I created a flip css class that esentially is invoked when I want to go to the next page and removed when I want to see the previous page. Learning about the proper z-index in order to satisfy the overlap and layering was a bit of challenge. 

Any issues you encountered
-I encountered issues with manipulating the bootstrap layout to obtain the layout I wanted for the seasonal wears, and again the code with the modal, I think also they're may have been an easier way to mimick a book that I could've done instead. - I also don't know how to keep my API on my page and push it to github, so I have to remove it when pushing to the github. 


What you learned in order to accomplish your project
// I learned a lot about bootstrap layouts like in regards to customizing the css whilst using the row, column components 
// I also learned a lot more with javascript in terms of how you can uses classes like for the book, I used a flipping class that works to perform the rotation effects 
 
Next steps – if you had more time and more tools, what would you do next?
- I want to involve more animations, and make the book bigger and look more appealing to the eye
- I also wanted to implement other APIs, but didn't have the chance to really think that through 
- I also wish I left more comments for readability purposes
